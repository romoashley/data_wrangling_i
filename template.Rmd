Let's import the `FAS_litters.csv` csv using a realtive path 
```{r} 
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r} 
#load data in a dataframe by using read_csv("datafile pathname"). This requires tidyverse to be loaded first.The pathname is within the project you are under. 

litters_df = read_csv("data/FAS_litters.csv") 
#change variable names to snake case 
#janitor::clean_names(dataframe) replaces that dataframe with an updated version with snake case variable names (upper case converted to lowercase, spaces converted to underscores, special characters get removed). The code janitor::clean_names(dataframe) says inside the janitor package, use the functon clean_names. 

litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df) 
# note: janitor is a package in R that has many functions. You can load the entire package like you did with tideverse. It would look like this: library(janitor). 
``` 

Import the same dataset using an absolute path. 

```{r} 
litters_df_abs = read_csv("/Users/ashleyromo/Desktop/P8105/data_wrangling_i/data/FAS_litters.csv") 

litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df) 

#if you move the location of the fodler with the data, the absolute path no longer works, which why it is always better to use relative paths.
```
