Import FAS litters and pups.

```{r}
litters_df =
  read_csv("data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df)

pups_df =
  read_csv("data/FAS_pups.csv")
pups_df = janitor::clean_names(pups_df)
```

## `select'

`select` is used to select columns!

```{r}
#select allows you to select columns. First, you specificy the dataframe. Then, you list the variables you want to select/keep. The order you list the variables is the order they will be organized in your dataframe. This is a good way to reorder variables.
select(litters_df, group, litter_number, gd0_weight)

select(litters_df, gd0_weight, group)

#using : allows you to select a range of varibles 
select(litters_df, group, gd0_weight:gd_of_birth)

# using starts_with("") allows you to select all the variables that start with the word you specify
select(litters_df, group, starts_with("pups"))

# using - allows you to delete the variable that comes after the -. 
select(litters_df, -litter_number)

# using - and starts_with allows you to delete all the variables that start with name you specify
select(litters_df, -starts_with("gd"))

# To rename a variable, you do new_name = old_name
select(litters_df, group, litter_id = litter_number)

# Including everything() allows you to keep all the variables you have not mentioned 
select(litters_df, group, litter_id = litter_number, everything())

# everything() is helpful when you just need to rearrange the order of the variables. For example, if you want to make gd0_weight the first column. 
select(litters_df,  gd0_weight, everything())
```


```{r}
# rename allows you to rename a variable and keep everything else
rename(litters_df, litter_id = litter_number)

#relocate allows you specify which variable you want to be listed first
relocate(litters_df, litter_number)
```

## Learning Assessment

```{r}
select(pups_df, litter_number, sex, pd_ears)
```


`select` vs `pull`
```{r}
# Select allows you to put.a dataframe in and a dataframe out. It does not care that there is only one column there. It is ALWAYS going to give you a dataframe. 
select(litters_df, group)

# Pull extracts a column from your dataframe and now it is just a vector floating around. It does not exist inside a datafame anymore.   
pull(litters_df, group)
```
